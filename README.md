## 📌 Project Overview
This project looks at how well **Advertisements (Ads)** work compared to **Public Service Announcements (PSAs)** when it comes to getting people to take action (convert). By using **A/B testing** and **Data Analysis**, we want to find out which of the two gets more people engaged and leads to more conversions.

### 📊 Key Findings
- **Ads are much better than PSAs** at getting people to convert.
- **Statistical results:**
  - **Difference in Conversion Rate:** 0.60%
  - **Improvement Percentage:** 45.94%
  - **Z-Statistic:** 6.49 (this means there’s a strong difference)
  - **P-Value:** rounded to around 0.0 (showing high significance)
- **Conclusion:** Ads are way more effective than PSAs for getting conversions.

## 🧪 Methodology
### **1. Data Collection & Preparation**
- We collected data on how users interacted with **Ads and PSAs**.
- We made sure to randomly select users so both groups were equal.
- We compared the conversion rates of these groups.
- **Outlier Filtering:** We used the **Interquartile Range (IQR) method** to remove any unusual data points for a more accurate analysis.
- **Database Connection:** We **migrated the dataset from Kaggle to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** and connected it to **Python and Power BI** for further analysis and visualization.

### **2. Statistical Analysis**
- **A/B Testing Approach:** 
  - We used a **Z-Test for proportions** to see if the differences were statistically significant.
  - The p-value helps us understand if what we’re seeing is just random chance.

- **Interpreting the Results:**
  - If the p-value is less than 0.05, the difference is considered **statistically significant**.
  - A high Z-score means the difference is **not just random**.
